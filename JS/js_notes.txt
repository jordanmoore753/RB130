In JS there are 7 data types:
1. number: 4, 8, 1516, 23.42
2. string: any grouping of characters surrounding by single or double quotes. prefer single quotes.
3. boolean: true or false.
4. null (instead of nil in Ruby): intentional absence of value
5. undefined: also represents the absence of value but with a different use than null
6. symbol: unique identifiers used in complex coding.
7. object: collections of related data.

1-6 are primitive data. objects are more complex.

--- operators

all the operators are the same as in Ruby
+, -, /, %, *

--- string concatenation

strings can be concatenated with + just like in Ruby

'woo' + 'yah' == wooyah!

--- instances of data type

each piece of data is saved to the browser as an instance!!!! of the data type

'woo' => string data type
2 -> number data type

each instance has properties, much like instances of a class in Ruby have instance variable, attributes, state.

console.log('Hello'.length); => 5

'.' is called the dot operator. 

---- Methods

methods are actions we can perform.
we call (invoke) these methods by appending an instance with a period (dot operator) the name of the method, and opening and closing parantheses

ex: 'hello world'.methodName()
