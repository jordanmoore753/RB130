# Variables in Ruby vs JS

Ruby: var = 'strin'
JS:   var myName = 'strin'

var is the keyword for declaring a new variable
myName is the variable's name, use camelCasing.

= is assignment operator

'strin' is the value assigned to variable myName.

- variable names cannot start with numbers
- variable names are case sensitive
- variable names cannot be keywords

# let variable declaration

let keyword signals that a variable can be reassigned
to a different value

you can even initialize a var or let without a value and it will be given value undefined

# const variable

const is short for constant. It cannot be reassigned.

# Increment and Decrement operators

++ = increment operator
-- = decrement operator

var a = 1
a++1;
console.log(a); => 2

# String Interpolation

const myPet = armadillo;
console.log(`I own a pet ${myPet}`)

backticks `` signify that there is going to be some string interpolation with variables

$ instead of # like in Ruby, followed by {}.

# typeof operator

If you need to check the type of data you're working with
in JS, use the typeof operator
  
    var myVar = 'strrr'
ex: typeof myVar => String
